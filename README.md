# Cristian Castro Toledo

I am a Puerto Rico-based operator and builder specialized in the management of healthcare financial and operational systems. My work focuses on the intersection of clinical documentation, physician compensation models, and overall revenue cycle optimization.

### Professional Background
- Clinical Literacy: Comprehensive understanding of medical sciences and clinical scenarios derived from a BS in Biology and medical school training. This includes the ability to interpret diagnostic findings and understand the complexities of patient-provider documentation.
- Healthcare Systems: Practical experience navigating the multi-variable financial models used by health insurance carriers and clinics to manage compensation and documentation compliance.
- Operations: Leading financial and operational strategies for physician clinics, focused on creating structured systems that allow for sustainable growth and data integrity.

### Technical Development
I am currently upskilling in software development to translate complex operational logic into automated, scalable systems. My objective is to bridge the gap between healthcare business requirements and technical execution.

- Learning Stack: CS50, Python, SQL, and Azure.
- Focus: Developing private, proprietary tools to solve specific bottlenecks in healthcare finance and operational management.
